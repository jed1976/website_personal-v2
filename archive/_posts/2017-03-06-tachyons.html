  <p class="f6 lh-copy ph3">Lately, I've been using a small, functional CSS library called <a class="b bg-black lightest-blue link hover-white pa1 pointer" href="http://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a> for all my styling needs.</p>
  <p class="f6 lh-copy ph3">This site was built with it, and if I have anything to say about it, everything else I do will too.</p>
  <p class="f6 lh-copy ph3">Like functional programming, this one takes some time to fully see the benefits of, but once you do, you cannot <b class="bg-navy pa1 tracked-mega ttu white">unsee</b> it.</p>
